Today we are building a small and simple authentication application
using vanilla JS , HTML and CSS - with bootstrap5.3. 

that will take in a user name , email , password 
and allow log in with the user name or email , along eith the 
password provided and the 12 key phrase. 
The 12 key phrase is generated upon creation ,and shown when creating the 
account for more security. 





The authentication application , should simply work 
and allow someone to visit a login page , with their account name on the top , after they sign up. 
- The subscription should be available - based ona  variable time. 

There should be a sign up , log in , 
then a main profile page , ( let them up load a picture and it stay in the corner - styled all well.  )
the main page should be displayed by default , and allow a log in , or sign up option as well. 



and visit the page that says - APP HOME PAGE.   the code should be structured , 
as to ptovide the user to have a log in , and to sign up with a subscription , weekly or monthly 
( the backend for this will be handled with stripe , but thats for later. )


if there is no subscription purchased , or active within the time constraints , 
give an alert and a pop up , instead of loading the page , 
but there should be a profile page as well , that dispalys subscription status with a green or red circle. 
and regular main profile info , etc. or info to save or contact them. 

Generate the code for this , a node server to in endpoints and a MySQL Database , to store log in credentials , 
and subscription - for 7 days and another for 30 days , 
this will be tested on the payment platform , but must be easily available in the code 
to be changed for testing. testing locally should work for now - 
by default.
- after " signing up for subscription " , either 7 or 30 days . 


I want also want  to test this all locally on XAMPP using  MySQL
